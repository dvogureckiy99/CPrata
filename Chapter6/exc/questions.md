1. Find the value of quack after each line; each of the final five statements uses the value of
quack produced by the preceding statement.

7,70,64,8,2

2. Given that value is an int , what output would the following loop produce?  
for ( value = 36; value > 0; value /= 2)  
printf("%3d", value);  
 36 18  9  4  2  1    
What problems would there be if value were double instead of int ?  
loop would never end in there.
